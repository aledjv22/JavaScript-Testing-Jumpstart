# JavaScript Testing Jumpstart

## Description

Welcome to the JavaScript Testing Jumpstart repository! Here you'll find all the files and resources used during the practical exercises of the "Introducci√≥n al Testing con JavaScript" course. This repository serves as a comprehensive reference for practicing and mastering JavaScript testing techniques.

## Project Configurations

This project uses ESLint and EditorConfig to maintain a consistent code style.

### ESLint

The ESLint configuration is found in the `.eslintrc.js` files in the `api` and `demos` folders. These files define the code style rules for JavaScript, including the use of the latest version of ECMAScript, and extending the Airbnb base rules.

For more details, you can review the [api/.eslintrc.js](api/.eslintrc.js) and [demos/.eslintrc.js](demos/.eslintrc.js) files.

### EditorConfig

The `.editorconfig` file defines some code style settings that are common to various text editors, such as indentation size and character set.

For more details, you can review the [.editorconfig](.editorconfig) file.
